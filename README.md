# Off-Axis-Hologram-Reconstruction-FRFT

A hologram reconstruction algorithm based on the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) in non-telecentric digital holographic microscopy. 
The optimal fractional order representing the recorded hologram is estimated based on an evaluation metric. 
The FRFT-based hologram reconstruction enables noise robust amplitude and phase imaging with enhanced resolution.
