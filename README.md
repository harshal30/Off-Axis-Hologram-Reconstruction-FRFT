# Off-Axis-Hologram-Reconstruction-FRFT

**Digital Hologram Reconstruction Algorithm**
This repository presents a digital hologram reconstruction algorithm based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT), specifically tailored for non-telecentric digital holographic microscopy. The optimal fractional order representing the recorded hologram is estimated based on an evaluation metric. The FRFT-based hologram reconstruction enables noise-robust amplitude and phase imaging with enhanced resolution. The project includes implementations in both Python and MATLAB.
